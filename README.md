# US Political Polarization

Politics has become a large societal concern in the United States and the polarizing stances on common issues has given way to social unrest, tension, and distrust. Utilizing data from [VoteView](https://www.voteview.com) and similar analysis from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/justin2028/political-polarization-us-congress-data-analysis), this report expands to the next stage from determining the existance of political polarity to identification of trends and influencing factors within the contained bodies of Congress.

We acknowledge the myriad existance of factors, both significant and inferred, beyond the scope any single analysis can ascertain; instead we hope to build a foundation for expansion and insight.
